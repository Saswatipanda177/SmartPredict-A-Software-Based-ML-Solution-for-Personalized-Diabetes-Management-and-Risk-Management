# SmartPredict: Predictive Analytics Framework

This repository contains the research work titled **SmartPredict**, which presents a structured and practical approach to building predictive analytics systems. The paper explains the process of data collection, preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and result analysis.

We have implemented the methods discussed in the paper and tested them to validate the outcomes. The Google Colab notebook containing the full implementation is also provided for reference and testing.

## Files Included

- ðŸ“„ `SmartPredict.101.pdf` â€“ Our research paper explaining the concept, approach, and results of the predictive analytics framework.
- ðŸ““ `Google Colab Notebook` â€“ The complete implementation of the system in Python.

## How to Use

1. Read through the PDF to understand the methodology.
2. Open the Colab notebook to view and run the implementation.

## Note

Make sure to have access to Google Colab and the necessary Python packages if you plan to run the notebook.
